# Timekeeper Calendar System

## 1. Overview

The Timekeeper system is a comprehensive calendar management solution for the circus school. It allows both administrators and users to create and manage time slots for courses, events, and personal sessions. The system integrates with the existing payment infrastructure and provides flexible visibility options for different types of events. The calendar serves as the central hub for all scheduling activities, with advanced filtering and search capabilities.

## 2. Core Requirements

### 2.1 Calendar Management
- **Admin Course Creation**: Administrators can create official courses that appear prominently in the calendar.
- **User-Generated Time Slots**: Users can create their own time slots that don't interfere with official courses.
- **Visibility Control**: Creators can set time slots as public or private with shareable links.
- **Concurrent Events**: System supports multiple events occurring simultaneously.

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- **Database Setup**
  - Create database schema with all required tables
  - Set up initial seed data (venues, sample courses)
  - Establish relationships between tables

- **Core API Development**
  - Implement basic CRUD endpoints for events
  - Create venue management endpoints
  - Set up authentication integration

- **Initial Frontend Structure**
  - Set up React application with React Big Calendar
  - Implement basic calendar view with event display
  - Create simple event creation form

- **Milestones:**
  - ✅ Frontend React application structure set up
  - ✅ Core UI components implemented
  - ✅ Basic calendar view and event handling
  - ⏳ Development server configuration (in progress)
  - ⏳ Backend API connection (pending)

### Current Implementation Status (Week 2)

The following components have been implemented in the frontend:
- Calendar View with React Big Calendar integration
- Event Creation Form with venue selection and timing controls
- Filter Bar with expandable search and filter options
- Payment Notification with modern, accessible design
- Basic UI components with Material-UI theming
- Responsive layout and mobile-friendly design

All core frontend components have been created with:
- Modern React practices (hooks, context)
- TypeScript for type safety
- Consistent styling and theming
- Accessibility considerations
- Error handling and loading states

### Next Steps
To complete Phase 1, the following tasks remain:

1. **Start Development Server**
   - Launch the Vite development server
   - Configure environment variables
   - Set up hot module replacement

2. **Backend API Connection**
   - Configure API endpoint URLs
   - Set up authentication headers
   - Implement API interceptors
   - Test API connectivity

Once these steps are completed, Phase 1 will be finalized and we can proceed to Phase 2.
